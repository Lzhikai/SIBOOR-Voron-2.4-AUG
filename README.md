### 2. TAP Assembly Tutorial  

- [Assembly_Manual_Tap.pdf](https://github.com/Lzhikai/SIBOOR-Voron-2.4-AUG/blob/main/Manual/Assembly_Manual_Tap.pdf)  

- Currently, TAP has been upgraded to the RCB version. See the differences in assembly with the old version in the following images.  
  
- **Belt handling:**
  The belts are now handled by looping around Tap_center, and secured with a printed belt cover and M3x8 BHCS:  
  ![Image](https://github.com/Lzhikai/SIBOOR-Voron-2.4-AUG/blob/main/Images/To_add_to_the%20page/supplementary%20page%20%20(2).jpg)  

- **Extra Stiffening:**
  The 2 M3x50 bolts are threaded up into Tap_Center, and serve to provide extra stiffening:

- **Vibration Resistance:**
  The heatset inserts for the center are moved back 4 mm to provide extra vibration resistance:

### 6. Networking and Configuration  

### Connect to WiFi
   - Prior to powering on the device, it is absolutely crucial to meticulously verify all electrical connections, ensuring strict adherence to the instructions, with 
   particular emphasis on the correct polarity of the power supply. Neglecting this essential step may lead to irreversible and severe consequences, causing irreparable 
   damage to the electrical equipment. It is imperative to follow these instructions without compromise for the safety and proper functionality of the device.
   - Connect the power cord, turn on the switch, and wait for the display screen to light up.
   - Tap on the "Menu" on the display screen.
   - Click on "Network."
   - Locate your WiFi network and tap the button on the right.
   - Enter the password and click "Save."
   - After returning to the previous level, find the device's IP address in the upper right corner.
  
   ![Network Image](https://github.com/Lzhikai/SIBOOR-Voron-2.4-AUG/blob/main/Images/network.jpg)

   After obtaining the IP address of the device, you can enter the control page by typing the IP into the browser using a computer or cell phone in the same LAN. Before officially starting debugging, please continue reading.
    
     
### Log in to SSH
### SSH Tools PUTTY

Putty is a Windows SSH client with a long history. It is available as a free download [here](https://www.putty.org/).

To connect with Putty:

- Open Putty
- Enter your username and hostname in the “hostname” field, in the format `<user>@<host>`, for example, `biqu@BTT-CB1`,
- Certainly. You can also connect to the device directly using the IP address, for example: `pi@192.168.50.87`.  
- Press the “Open” button  

   ![Putty Image 1](https://github.com/Lzhikai/SIBOOR-Voron-2.4-AUG/blob/main/Images/ssh1.jpg)

- Since this is your first time connecting to this remote machine, you will encounter a security warning. It should be safe to just click accept.  

   ![Putty Image 2](https://github.com/Lzhikai/SIBOOR-Voron-2.4-AUG/blob/main/Images/ssh2.png)

### Putty Security Alert

- You will then find yourself with a black window and a password prompt. Type your password and press enter. It is normal for nothing to appear on the screen while you are typing the password.
- (Linux applications traditionally hide passwords completely rather than the more familiar dots or stars)

*Note: Account and password are case-sensitive.*


### Connect the Octopus Pro Mainboard
   - Use a USB cable to connect the mainboard to Pi and connect via SSH.
   - Enter the following commands:
     ```bash
     cd ~/CanBoot/scripts
     python3 flash_can.py -i can0 -q
     ```  
   <br/><img src=https://github.com/Lzhikai/SIBOOR-Voron-2.4-AUG/blob/main/Images/connect1.png width="1080"/><br/>  
   
   - The displayed UUID is the mainboard's UUID. Copy and paste it into the corresponding location in the configuration file (cfg) document.

   <br/><img src=https://github.com/Lzhikai/SIBOOR-Voron-2.4-AUG/blob/main/Images/connect2.png width="1080"/><br/> 

### Connect the EBB CAN Board  
   - Run the following command again:
     ```bash
     python3 flash_can.py -i can0 -q
     ```  
   <br/><img src=https://github.com/Lzhikai/SIBOOR-Voron-2.4-AUG/blob/main/Images/connect3.png width="1080"/><br/>  
   
   - Obtain the UUID for the EBB CAN bus, copy it, and paste it into the corresponding location in the configuration file (cfg).  
   
   <br/><img src=https://github.com/Lzhikai/SIBOOR-Voron-2.4-AUG/blob/main/Images/connect4.png width="1080"/><br/> 
   
   - Click Save and restart to complete the device connection.

## FAQ

- Where can I find the BOM list for SIBOOR V2.4 [AUG] to verify my package?  
  [Access the BOM list for SIBOOR V2.4 [AUG]](link).

- Is it necessary to burn the system and firmware?  
  The Pi's built-in system is pre-matched with the mainboard and CAN bus. Avoid version upgrades unless issues arise. 

- Why are some metal structural components unused?  
  Certain parts are designed for the Afterburner version and are not applicable here. Remove them before assembly.

- Why are some screws in different positions from the official instructions?  
  Due to metal processing and weight reduction, some screws differ. See red annotations in Assembly_Manual_2.4r2.

- What are the Klipper account credentials?  
  Username: biqu, Password: biqu (Note: Case-sensitive)

- Why can't my Dragon hotend be installed on the printed part?  
  Remove the cylindrical joint on top of the Dragon hotend before installation. See illustration below.

- Why is there only one drag chain in my kit?  
  SIBOOR V2.4 [AUG] uses a CAN board, eliminating the need for X and Y axis drag chains. Wires will hang inside the chamber, reducing wear and poor contacts.

- Why can't my Z-axis reach the top due to the length limit of the Z-axis drag chain?  
  Removing the X and Y axis drag chains increases visible space, but printing height is still limited. For example, the 300 model can print up to around 280mm, and the 350 model up to around 330mm.

- Why are there no honeycomb skirts and fixed box panels in the kit?  
  If you didn't purchase decorative parts separately, you need to 3D print them.  [Download here](link).

- Why are the motor wires for the X-axis and Y-axis not long enough?  
  This brand of motor has a standard wire length of one meter and requires the use of the red cable and JST terminal extension included in the kit. (X) B motor is recommended to be extended to 2 meters, and Y (A) 
  motor is recommended to be extended to 1.5 meters.

- Why does the hotend lower to 150℃ before raising to the printing temperature during pre-print preparation?  
  This is to prevent damage to the print bed in the event that the hot end heats up to high temperatures.

- How can I get technical support or after-sales service?
  

- Where can I download the system if mine is damaged?
