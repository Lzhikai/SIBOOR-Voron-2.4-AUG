### 2. TAP Assembly Tutorial  

- [Assembly_Manual_Tap.pdf](https://github.com/Lzhikai/SIBOOR-Voron-2.4-AUG/blob/main/Manual/Assembly_Manual_Tap.pdf)  

- Currently, TAP has been upgraded to the RCB version. See the differences in assembly with the old version in the following images.  
  
- **Belt handling:**
  The belts are now handled by looping around Tap_center, and secured with a printed belt cover and M3x8 BHCS:

- **Extra Stiffening:**
  The 2 M3x50 bolts are threaded up into Tap_Center, and serve to provide extra stiffening:

- **Vibration Resistance:**
  The heatset inserts for the center are moved back 4 mm to provide extra vibration resistance:

- **Secure with Screws:**
  So they will need to be secured with M3x12 and M3x16 SHCS (The top is still secured by M3x6 SHCS):

   After obtaining the IP address of the device, you can enter the control page by typing the IP into the browser using a computer or cell phone in the same LAN. Before officially starting debugging, please continue reading.
    
     
### Log in to SSH
   - Use PuTTY software to connect to SSH.
   - **Username:** biqu
   - **Password:** biqu (Note: Account and password are case-sensitive.)

### Connect the Octopus Pro Mainboard
   - Use a USB cable to connect the mainboard to Pi and connect via SSH.
   - Enter the following commands:
     ```bash
     cd ~/CanBoot/scripts
     python3 flash_can.py -i can0 -q
     ```  
   <br/><img src=https://github.com/Lzhikai/SIBOOR-Voron-2.4-AUG/blob/main/Images/connect1.png width="1080"/><br/>  
   
   - The displayed UUID is the mainboard's UUID. Copy and paste it into the corresponding location in the configuration file (cfg) document.

## FAQ

- Where can I find the BOM list for SIBOOR V2.4 [AUG] to verify my package?  
  [Access the BOM list for SIBOOR V2.4 [AUG]](link).

- Is it necessary to burn the system and firmware?  
  The Pi's built-in system is pre-matched with the mainboard and CAN bus. Avoid version upgrades unless issues arise. 

- Why are some metal structural components unused?  
  Certain parts are designed for the Afterburner version and are not applicable here. Remove them before assembly.

- Why are some screws in different positions from the official instructions?  
  Due to metal processing and weight reduction, some screws differ. See red annotations in Assembly_Manual_2.4r2.

- What are the Klipper account credentials?  
  Username: biqu, Password: biqu (Note: Case-sensitive)

- Why can't my Dragon hotend be installed on the printed part?  
  Remove the cylindrical joint on top of the Dragon hotend before installation. See illustration below.

- Why is there only one drag chain in my kit?  
  SIBOOR V2.4 [AUG] uses a CAN board, eliminating the need for X and Y axis drag chains. Wires will hang inside the chamber, reducing wear and poor contacts.

- Why can't my Z-axis reach the top due to the length limit of the Z-axis drag chain?  
  Removing the X and Y axis drag chains increases visible space, but printing height is still limited. For example, the 300 model can print up to around 280mm, and the 350 model up to around 330mm.

- Why are there no honeycomb skirts and fixed box panels in the kit?  
  If you didn't purchase decorative parts separately, you need to 3D print them.  [Download here](link).

- Why are the motor wires for the X-axis and Y-axis not long enough?  
  This brand of motor has a standard wire length of one meter and requires the use of the red cable and JST terminal extension included in the kit. (X) B motor is recommended to be extended to 2 meters, and Y (A) 
  motor is recommended to be extended to 1.5 meters.

- Why does the hotend lower to 150â„ƒ before raising to the printing temperature during pre-print preparation?

- How can I get technical support or after-sales service?

- Where can I download the system if mine is damaged?
