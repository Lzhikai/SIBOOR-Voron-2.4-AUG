## Assembly Guide

### 1. Assembly Manual 2.4r2
- [Assembly_Manual 2.4r2 SIBOOR Annotation Version.pdf](https://github.com/Lzhikai/SIBOOR-Voron-2.4-AUG/blob/main/Manual/Assembly_Manual_2.4r2%EF%BC%88SIBOOR%20Annotation%20Version%EF%BC%89.pdf)  

- Pay close attention to manual comments.After downloading, open the file using a browser or PDF software to view the annotation content!

- Green-highlighted sections denote variances between SIBOOR V2.4 [AUG] and VORON's official BOM.

- Red-highlighted sections indicate differences in metal structural components between SIBOOR V2.4 [AUG] and VORON's official BOM.

### 2. TAP Assembly Tutorial
- [Assembly_Manual_Tap.pdf](https://github.com/Lzhikai/SIBOOR-Voron-2.4-AUG/blob/main/Manual/Assembly_Manual_Tap.pdf)

- Currently, TAP has been upgraded to the RCB version. See the differences in assembly with the old version in the following images.
  
- Belt handling,The belts are now handled by looping around Tap_center, and secured with a printed belt cover and M3x8 BHCS:

- the 2 M3x50 bolts are threaded up into Tap_Center, and serve to provide extra stiffening:

- The heatset inserts for the center are moved back 4 mm to provide extra vibration resistance:

- So they will need to be secured with M3x12 and M3x16 SHCS:

(The top is still secured by M3x6 SHCS)  

### 3. Stealthburner Assembly Tutorial
- [Assembly_Manual_Stealthburner.pdf](https://github.com/Lzhikai/SIBOOR-Voron-2.4-AUG/blob/main/Manual/Assembly_Manual_SB%EF%BC%88SIBOOR%20Annotation%20Version%EF%BC%89.pdf)
- Install the heating rod and thermistor.
- Set up the CAN board, illustrate wiring, and set jumpers.
- Install the Y-axis limit switch.
- Install CAN board cables and steel wires.

### 4. Display Installation

### 5. Nevermore Installation

### 6. Wiring and Inspection

### 7. Networking and Configuration
1. Before debugging, ensure MCU communication between the CAN board and the mainboard is established.

## FAQ

- Where can I find the BOM list for SIBOOR V2.4 [AUG] to verify my package?  
  Access the BOM list for SIBOOR V2.4 [AUG] [here](link).

- Is it necessary to burn the system and firmware?
  The Pi's built-in system is pre-matched with the mainboard and CAN bus. Avoid version upgrades unless issues arise.  

- Why are some metal structural components unused?  
  Certain parts are designed for the Afterburner version and are not applicable here. Remove them before assembly.

- Why are some screws in different positions from the official instructions?  
  Due to metal processing and weight reduction, some screws differ. See red annotations in Assembly_Manual_2.4r2.

- What are the Klipper account credentials?  
  Username: biqu, Password: biqu (Note: Case-sensitive)

- Why can't my Dragon hotend be installed on the printed part?  
  Remove the cylindrical joint on top of the Dragon hotend before installation. See illustration below.

- Why is there only one drag chain in my kit?  
  SIBOOR V2.4 [AUG] uses a CAN board, eliminating the need for X and Y axis drag chains. Wires will hang inside the chamber, reducing wear and poor contacts.

- Why can't my Z-axis reach the top due to the length limit of the Z-axis drag chain?  
  Removing the X and Y axis drag chains increases visible space, but printing height is still limited. For example, the 300 model can print up to around 280mm, and the 350 model up to around 330mm.

- Why are there no honeycomb skirts and fixed box panels in the kit?  
  If you didn't purchase decorative parts separately, you need to 3D print them. Download [here](link).

- Why does the hotend lower to 150â„ƒ before raising to the printing temperature during pre-print preparation?

- How can I get technical support or after-sales service?

- Where can I download the system if mine is damaged?
